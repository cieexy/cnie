        <p><strong>Hi, my name is Anna Nabilah.</strong></p> 
        <p>I am 20 years old and I was born on 18 July 2005. I am a Mass Communication (MC110) student at UiTM Alor Gajah, Melaka.</p>
        <p>Out of all the things I enjoy, there is one thing that never fails to bring me peace and happiness. I have a deep love for flowers. Collecting them, arranging them, and even simply buying them has become something very special to me. It might seem like a small passion but for me, flowers are a source of beauty, calm, and love. I admire the way each blossom carries its own character. The colors, the shapes, the scents all of it feels so alive and comforting.</p>

    <p class="flower-meaning">
      From my perspective, flowers carry many different meanings depending on culture, situations, and personal experiences. To me, flowers are symbols of beauty, grace, and elegance, which is why they are often used in decorations, fashion, and art. I associate flowers with joy and affection in so many ways. For example, represent romantic love, while lilies can symbolize purity or sympathy. Flowers also represent life, growth, and hope, as their blooming feels like a sign of new beginnings and positivity. I think giving flowers is a beautiful way to express emotions such as love, sympathy, gratitude, or congratulations.
