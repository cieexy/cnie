    <p class="flower-meaning">
      I love the pink Gerbera daisy because it feels like happiness in the form of a flower. Its soft, round petals open so beautifully, as if it’s smiling back at me. There’s something calming about its gentle pink color it’s not too loud, but it still stands out with its own quiet confidence.
      This flower makes me feel peaceful, cheerful, and comforted. It reminds me that even simple things can be full of beauty. I love how it represents kindness, love, and positivity—the kind of energy I always want around me.
