    <p class="flower-meaning">
     I love chamomile because of the sense of peace and warmth it brings. There's something incredibly comforting about its soft fragrance and gentle nature it feels like a quiet hug in flower form. Whether it’s sipping a cup of chamomile tea on a slow evening or using chamomile-infused skincare after a long day, it always gives me a sense of calm and balance. I also admire how something so small and delicate holds such natural healing power. Chamomile reminds me to slow down, breathe, and find beauty in softness.

It has been used for centuries in herbal medicine and is most commonly found in tea, essential oils, and skincare. Chamomile is famous for its soothing effects, especially in helping with relaxation, sleep, and stress relief.
